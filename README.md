### Project Overview Script

*Assignment Context:*
"As per the assignment brief, the objective was to develop a single-page application that visualizes AI data. This dashboard displays data fetched from a mock AI service and presents it in a visually appealing and interactive manner."

*Key Features:*
1. *Application Setup:*
   - "The project was initialized using Create React App, and TypeScript was integrated for type safety."

2. *Mock AI Service Integration:*
   - "I utilized a provided JSON file to simulate fetching data from an AI service. The data includes insights such category distribution, average response times, user satisfaction, usage statistics."

3. *Data Visualization:*
   - "For data visualization, I implemented one interactive charts using [Recharts]. We have a bar chart for category distribution and a line chart for response times, showcasing trends over time."

4. *State Management:*
   - "Redux was used for state management. I created separate slices for different data categories, allowing seamless updates and management of the application state."

5. *Styling and Layout:*
   - "The application was styled using CSS and SCSS, ensuring a clean and modern layout. I paid special attention to responsiveness, ensuring that the dashboard functions well on various screen sizes."

6. *Frontend Design:*
   - "The user interface is designed for intuitive interaction with the data, featuring a consistent theme across all components. I incorporated hover effects and animations to enhance user experience."

*Dashboard Demonstration:*
- (Here, navigate through your application and highlight key components)
   - "As you can see, the dashboard provides a clear summary of insights category distribution, average response times, user satisfaction, usage statistics."
   - "Here’s the category distribution, displayed as a bar chart, which shows the number of queries across different categories."
   - "Additionally, the response times are illustrated through a line chart, allowing users to observe trends over days and weeks."
   - "I’ve also included user satisfaction ratings and usage statistics, represented through various charts, to provide a comprehensive overview."

*Conclusion:*
"In conclusion, this project not only demonstrates my technical skills in React and Redux but also my ability to create a user-friendly and visually appealing application. I hope you find this dashboard insightful. Thank you for your time!".
